# DeltaBridge
extensive collection of bridging cross chain blockchain solutions

DeltaBridge is a collection of tools and protocols designed to facilitate seamless cross-chain communication and interoperability. This repository hosts various projects that leverage different blockchain technologies to enable efficient and secure data and value transfer across multiple chains.
Overview

DeltaBridge offers solutions for building and deploying cross-chain bridges, allowing for the synchronization of blockchain states and the transfer of assets and messages across different blockchain networks. Our projects include implementations for bridging Substrate-based chains, EVM-based chains, and more.
Projects
3DPass Cross-chain Bridge

The 3DPass Cross-chain Bridge project includes Substrate pallets for syncing headers, passing arbitrary messages, and libraries for building relayers. This project is designed to facilitate cross-chain communication between Substrate-based chains. More details can be found in the 3DPass Cross-chain Bridge repository.
LayerZero

LayerZero provides omnichain contracts that support cross-chain ERC20 and ERC721 token functionality. This includes OmnichainFungibleToken and OmnichainNonFungibleToken721 contracts that enable minting and transferring tokens across supported LayerZero chains. Check out the LayerZero repository for more information.
Wormhole NativeSwap Example

This project demonstrates a multi-chain native-to-native token swap using existing decentralized exchanges (DEXes). It leverages the Wormhole protocol to facilitate cross-chain swaps between Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. For more details, visit the Wormhole NativeSwap Example repository.
Stacks Wallet Web

The Stacks Wallet Web is a browser extension for managing digital assets and connecting to applications built with the Stacks blockchain. This wallet supports interaction with the Stacks blockchain directly from your browser. More information is available in the Stacks Wallet Web repository.
